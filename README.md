# Optional Quick Response Safety System - OQR2S

This project was devised to solve the problem of human safety in hard-to-reach places and more. This project is a complex of various systems that provides the ability to have increased safety in various situations. The project involves working in completely different places and “elements”.

Accidents and emergencies that happen to people in unpredictable situations are not uncommon. Let's look at a couple of fairly common incidents with people.

For example, during the swimming season in rocky areas, where people jump into the water from the rocks. After a possible unsuccessful jump and “splashdown”, people lose consciousness from hitting the water or hitting the rocks underwater, thereby drowning. It's good if a person is in a company of people and they managed to save him, it's bad if the person is alone. Considering the clear statistics of victims who died at sea during the summer season in Aktau, rescuers who were constantly at the jump sites cannot help a person in time. Will you say that these cases occur with a probability of 1%? This is not true, every day since the beginning of the swimming season there are news about people drowning due to underwater currents or loss of consciousness in the water. Ask if this news stops people? No and no. Don't believe me? Take a look at the news feed of the summer season of Aktau, I can say with confidence that you will be amazed.

Have you ever heard of people lost in the woods or places unknown to them? Quite often, people during a trip to unknown places get lost in the territory and cannot find their way back. In places remote from civilization, there is rarely a cellular connection. Such cases often happen to both children and adults.

It would be easier to create the possibility of equipping people with a means of absolute safety than to take non-working methods of conducting public awareness, methods of a larger departure of rescuers or methods of limiting the areas of people's presence.
There is an opportunity to perfectly eradicate problems, using a couple of devices about which we will talk later.
